%  
%  This code extracts fracture traces from images of fractured rock. The
%  extraction is performed using the complex shearlet ridge measure. The
%  ridge measure is computed on an ensemble of shearlet parameters to
%  obtain a ridge ensemble. A highly probable ridge realization is obtained
%  from the ridge ensemble using a threshold ridge strength. The ridges
%  are converted to fractures using image processing steps such as Otsu
%  thresholding, skeletonization and polyline fitting.
